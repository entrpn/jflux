JAX Implementation [`flax.nnx`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) of Black Forest Labs' FLUX Family of Models. **JFLUX** is a port from the official PyTorch implementation into JAX, using the [`flax.nnx`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) framework.


## Features

- **Full JAX Implementation**: The FLUX.1 family of models, originally built in PyTorch, have been fully re-implemented in JAX.
- **Support for Flux Variants**: Includes support for FLUX.1 variants namely [schnell](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell) and [dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev). (tested on schnell on an A100)
- **Open-Source and Community-Driven**: We encourage contributions and collaboration to further improve the performance and capabilities of this repository. (Refer to the Roadmap Section for more details)

## Installation

To get started, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ml-gde/jflux.git
   cd jflux
   ```
2. With python version `>=3.10`, run the model with a prompt (install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) beforehand):
   ```bash
   uv run jflux
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> This might help ðŸ˜ƒ
> ```
> uv python install 3.10
> uv python pin 3.10
> ```
>
> If you don't have `uv` you can run the following command to get running
> ```
> cd jflux && pip install -U pip && pip install -e .
> ```

## Usage

Once installed, JFLUX can be used to generate high-quality images from text prompts via a cli. For example:

```bash
uv run jflux --prompt "A cute dog"
```

Additional options are available to adjust resolution, sampling steps, and more.

## Hiccups and Known Issues

There are a few challenges weâ€™re actively working to resolve. We encourage contributions from the community to help improve the project:

- **No TPU Support**: As of now, the code does not support TPUs.
- **High VRAM Requirements**: Running `flux-schnell` currently requires **40 GB of VRAM** (A100 or higher).
- **Image Generation Time**: Image generation takes longer than expected, especially for high-resolution outputs (takes ~51s on an A100).
- **bfloat16 Upcasting**: Weights are upcasted from bfloat16 to fp32 because **NumPy** does not handle bf16 natively, leading to some inefficiencies.
- **porting weights**: Currently, we load pytorch weights and convert them to JAX tensors during inference; however, it would be ideal if, after the first run, we serialise the next weights to avoid redundant conversions in each run.
- **pure JAX inference**: As of now, we load the `t5` and `clip` models as torch `Module` and wrap their outputs as JAX arrays. This prevents OOM while inference; having a pure JAX inference pipeline would be ideal.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add TPU support
- [ ] Optimize VRAM usage with gradient checkpointing
- [ ] Explore further optimizations for image generation time
- [ ] Improve the handling of bfloat16 tensors with JAX
- [ ] Serialise `nnx` weights during cli run
- [ ] Port `t5` and `clip` models to `nnx.Module`
